- What is HTTP?<br><br>
Hypertext Transfer Protocol; it's how browsers and servers communicate.

- What is a URL?<br><br>


- What is DNS?<br><br>
Document naming system; it takes the name of the website and translates it into an IP address<br><br>

- What is a query string?<br><br>
At the end of a url, the query string provides some extra information that can be used by the server to modify the page<br><br>

- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?<br><br>
GET and POST; get does not change the website at all, and post will make changes/create an item for example<br><br>

- What is an HTTP request?<br><br>
A request made by the user not the server to access something on the server<br><br>

- What is an HTTP response?<br><br>
An action from the server back to the user in response to the requested information.<br><br>

- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.<br><br>
Part of a request that will include the hostname, date, language, cookies, etc.<br><br>

- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?<br><br>
The host name will first be translated into an IP address for the user's device to access, then using HTTP protocol, a request will be made to access the header and page information which will be delivered by the server back to the user's browser.<br><br>
